# EmployeeHideout || CMS Challenge

## Description

This project made us utilize MySQL. We made a database that allowed the user to add employees into the database, a job, or a new department. It allowed the user 
to view all employees' their salaries, what department they belong to, and see who their manager is. It also allows you to update an employee's records.

## Installation

Git clone, run: npm install to install all dependencies to use the app locally. When all dependencies are installed you must run: node server.js. Run that in your terminal and then the database AI will open and ask what you request.
